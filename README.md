- **Health Risk Assessment (`assesment.html`)**: Interactive tool for users to assess their health risks, view risk evolution, and receive mitigation strategies.
- **Personalized Risk & Benefits Overview (`card.html`)**: Visualizes user-specific risks (e.g., skiing, home, travel) and corresponding insurance benefits.
- **Chatbot Advisor (`chatbot.html`)**: Conversational interface for users to get insurance advice and receive optimal policy proposals.
- **Assessment/Test Flow (`test.html`)**: Engaging questionnaire to profile user preferences and risk attitudes.
- **Info & Discovery (`info.html`)**: Explains the platform's value, profiling, risk assessment, and simulation tools.
